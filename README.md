# Genetic Algorithm

## Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)

generation based:

steady state: adds and deletes individuals to current population
Standard selection schemes (STD):
- porportionate
- truncation
- ranking
- tournament
- Boltzmann's (less known)

All have the property and goal to evolve the *population* toward higher fitness.

Problems:
- multiple parameters, constant or dinnamic...
- premature convergence
- no convergence
To research:

-multiobjective evolutionary algorithms
